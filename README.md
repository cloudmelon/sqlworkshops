# SQL Server and Azure SQL Labs and Workshops
## (https://aka.ms/sqlworkshops)

This [site](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) is a map of learning content produced by and curated by the SQL Server and Azure SQL teams in Microsoft Engineering. These materials are meant to be instructor-led, but you can work through the materials on a test system on your own if desired. Labs are shorter and Workshops are more comprehensive. You can view all materials directly in this interface, or you can [view the raw github site for this content here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops).

To download a Workshop or Lab to your local computer, navigate to the Workshop or Lab's *github page* using the links below. Once there, click the **Clone or Download** button you see there. [More about that process is here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

*See the license information at the bottom of this README.md file*

## Learning how to self-learn

Many of these topics are quite deep, and take time to fully absorb. There are several phases of learning:

 - Awareness (You learn a technology exists and what it is used for)
 - Understanding (You learn the components, processes and steps of a technology)
 - Practice (You can perform the steps with the technology by following a process to complete a task)
 - Mastery (You are able to explain the technology to others)

[If you need a general "Data Literacy" course, you can find that here.](https://github.com/BuckWoody/presentations/tree/master/dataliteracy)

These courses are designed for you to repeat many times to move through these phases. Before you embark on any of these, you may want to complete a "Learning how to Learn" course. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="_blank">You can find more information on that here</a>.
